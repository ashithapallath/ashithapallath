# About Me  
Hey there! 👋 I’m Ashitha, an Integrated MSc Computer Science student with a focus on Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. I’m passionate about machine learning and enjoy the challenge of using AI to tackle real-world problems in creative ways.

Working with data is my happy place—it’s like solving a puzzle, and I love uncovering the stories hidden within the numbers. Whether it’s building models, experimenting with new tools, or just making sense of chaotic datasets, I’m always up for the challenge.
