# About Me  
Hey there! 👋 I’m Ashitha, an Integrated MSc Computer Science student with a focus on Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. I’m passionate about machine learning and enjoy the challenge of using AI to tackle real-world problems in creative ways.

Working with data is my happy place—it’s like solving a puzzle, and I love uncovering the stories hidden within the numbers. Whether it’s building models, experimenting with new tools, or just making sense of chaotic datasets, I’m always up for the challenge. Fun fact: I’m not a coffee lover, but I still manage to keep the energy going! 🌟  

When I’m not deep into coding or brainstorming, you’ll probably find me exploring the latest tech trends or thinking up fun side projects. Let’s connect and create something amazing!
